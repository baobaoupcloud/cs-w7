One of the problems that can arise in real-world applications of SQL is what is called an injection attack. An injection attack is where a malicious actor could input malicious SQL code.
For example, consider a login screen as follows:

![login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baobaoupcloud/cs-w7/main/static/images/4.injectionattacks/injectionattacks1.png)

You should never trust the users, do not use formatted strings as below to query:
```python
rows = db.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'")
```

Without the proper protections in our own code, a bad actor could run malicious code. Consider the following:

```python
rows = db.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?", username, password)
```
Notice that because the `?` is in place, validation can be run on favorite before it is blindly accepted by the query.
You never want to utilize formatted strings in queries as above or blindly trust the userâ€™s input.
Utilizing the CS50 Library, the library will sanitize and remove any potentially malicious characters.

That's all of week 7 ^^
